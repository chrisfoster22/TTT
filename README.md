# Tic Tac Toe: Nightmare Mode

This is a game of tic tac toe that is unwinnable. The first player is chosen at
random, and play proceeds until you lose or draw. You will not win.

To play, clone this repository and run $ ruby game.rb.

After every computer turn, the board will display. You will be prompted to enter
a a letter (T for Top, M for Middle, B for Bottom). You will then be prompted to
enter a number (1, 2, or 3) which corresponds to a column. You will be able to
enter another set of coordinates if you choose a spot that was already chosen.

You will be asked to play again after you lose.

Enjoy!
